## Data Generation

The data generation methodology draws inspiration from Alpaca, though with several simplifications to streamline the process. By leveraging the DeepSeek Chat API for generation, we were able to complete the asynchronous requests in approximately 17.5 hours, with the total API costs remaining under $35 USD (approximately 250 CNY)

## LoRA Finetuning
